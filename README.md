# ITSM Incident Management Improvement using Machine Learning

### 📖 Project Overview
**ABC Tech**, a mid-size IT services company, handles around 22–25K IT incidents each month under a mature ITIL framework.  
Despite this, customer surveys rated **incident management performance as poor**. To address this, ABC Tech initiated a **Machine Learning (ML)** project to enhance ITSM efficiency through automation and prediction.

### 🎯 Project Objectives
Apply ML to optimize ITSM processes in four key areas:
1. **High-Priority Ticket Prediction** – Detect Priority 1 & 2 incidents early to enable preventive action.  
2. **Incident Volume Forecasting** – Forecast ticket load quarterly and annually for better resource planning.  
3. **Auto-Tagging & Classification** – Automatically assign tickets to the right priority and department, reducing reassignment delays.  
4. **RFC & Asset Failure Prediction** – Predict possible configuration issues or system failures for proactive maintenance.

### 🧠 Key Steps & Outcomes
- Extracted and managed **46K+ IT incident records** from a **MySQL database using SQL queries**.  
- Built and compared models including **SVC, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and ARIMA** for classification and forecasting tasks.  
- Achieved **100% accuracy** in high-priority ticket prediction and **83% accuracy** in RFC failure forecasting.  
- Automated ticket handling and improved **service reliability and customer satisfaction**.
